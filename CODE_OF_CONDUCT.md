# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We are committed to providing a welcoming, respectful, and harassment-free environment for everyoneâ€”regardless of age, gender, race, religion, ability, identity, or experience level.

We want this project to be a safe and productive place for collaboration, learning, and contribution.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Being kind and respectful in all interactions
- Offering constructive feedback
- Receiving feedback with openness and professionalism
- Helping others grow
- Welcoming new contributors

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Personal attacks or insults
- Harassment, bullying, or discrimination
- Dismissing others or being intentionally unhelpful
- Publishing private information without consent
- Repeated disruptive behavior

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for:

- Enforcing the Code of Conduct
- Addressing inappropriate behavior promptly and fairly
- Keeping the community respectful and inclusive

They have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that violate this Code of Conduct.

## Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

- Contact a maintainer privately via email or direct message
- Include as much detail as possible (who, what, when, where)
- Reports will be kept confidential and addressed quickly

We will not tolerate retaliation against anyone who reports a concern in good faith.

## Enforcement

Actions taken may include:

- A warning
- A temporary or permanent ban from contributions
- Removal from community spaces (e.g., Discord, Slack, etc.)

Our goal is always education and resolution, but we will act to protect the community if needed.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1.
